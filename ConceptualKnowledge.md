1. What is a smart contract? How are they deployed?

A smart contract is a self-executing contract whose terms of the agreement between the contractâ€™s counterparties are written into lines of code stored on the blockchain.

Smart contracts are deployed in a way that.
The contract terms are developed into codes.

It is then compiled and stored in the blockchain network and is replicated among the participants in the blockchain.

Then, the code is run and executed by all computers in the network.
If a term of the contract is satisfied and it is verified by all participants of the blockchain network, then the relevant transaction is executed.

 Then, the code is run and executed by all computers in the network. If a term of the contract is satisfied and then the relevant transaction is executed.


2. What is gas? Why is gas optimization such a big focus when building smart contracts?

gas refers to the cost necessary to perform a transaction on the network.
Miners set the price of gas based on supply and demand for the computational power of the network needed to process smart contracts and other 
Gas optimizeation preserves capital.the higher the gas fee incurred,the costlier smart contract becomes

3. What is a hash? Why do people use hashing to hide information?

A hash is a unique fixed length string meant to identify a piece of data.They are created by placing the said data into a hash function. 
Hash is use to hide information and mask transaction because it protects the immutability of data stored and it serves as a unique identifier of the data/transaction. 

4.How would you proof to  colorblind person that two colored objects are actually of different colors?

I would ask the colorblind person to uniquely mark one of the colored object in a way only known to him,i would then proceed to choose an object of a particular color.
if i can successfully choose only one particular colored object in atleast 5 shuffled trials(either the marked or unmarked one)  i have then proved using Zero Knowledge proof that 
they are of two different colors.
